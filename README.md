# 🤖 HellBOT – Fire & Gas Detection Robot  

This is my **CSE 4326 – Microprocessors and Microcontrollers Laboratory Project**, completed in the **Summer 242 Trimester** at **United International University (UIU)**.  
HellBOT is an **Arduino-based smart robot** that detects fire and gas leaks, avoids obstacles, and automatically extinguishes fires using a water pump.

---

## 🚀 Overview  
**HellBOT** is designed for **fire safety automation**. It uses flame and gas sensors for hazard detection, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle avoidance, and an ESP32-CAM for real-time video monitoring.  
The system can operate in both **manual** and **autonomous** modes, ensuring fast response and enhanced safety in homes or industrial spaces.
